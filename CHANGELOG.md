## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- Initial release
- 11 MCP tools: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `batch_edit`, `search`, `similar`, `glob`, `batch_read`, `diff`, `stats`, `clear`
- Smart file reading with diff-mode — unchanged files cost ~5 tokens, modified files return unified diffs (80–95% savings)
- Semantic similarity search via local ONNX embeddings (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5, no API keys)
- Persistent LSH index for O(1) similarity lookups; serialized to SQLite, survives restarts
- Batch embedding — all new/changed files in a `batch_read` are embedded in a single model call
- Line-range editing for `edit` and `batch_edit` — scoped find/replace and direct line replacement
- int8 quantized embedding storage (388 bytes/vector, 22x smaller than float32)
- SIMD-parallel content-defined chunking (~70–95 MB/s), BLAKE3 hashing, ZSTD compression
- LRU-K eviction with 10,000-entry default; DoS limits on write size, match count, and glob scope
- `diff_mode=false` on `batch_read` for full content recovery after LLM context compression
- `append=true` on `write` for chunked large file writes
- `cached_only=true` on `glob` to filter to already-cached files
