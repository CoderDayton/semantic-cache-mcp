# Troubleshooting

## Embedding Model Issues

**"Embedding model not loaded"**
- **Cause:** First startup triggers a one-time model download (~130MB for BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5)
- **Fix:** Wait for the download to complete — progress is logged at INFO level. Subsequent starts are fast (model is cached locally).
- **Model location:** `~/.cache/semantic-cache-mcp/models/`

**Slow first request after restart**
- **Cause:** ONNX Runtime warms up the model on the first inference
- **Fix:** The server performs a warmup pass at startup. If latency is still high on first use, check available memory — bge-small-en-v1.5 needs ~200MB resident (ONNX Runtime + model weights).

**"Embedding failed" in logs**
- **Cause:** Model not yet loaded, or ONNX Runtime error
- **Fix:** Check `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` output. Verify `~/.cache/semantic-cache-mcp/models/` exists and is not empty.

## Tokenizer Issues

**"Tokenizer not loaded, using heuristic fallback"**
- **Cause:** Failed to download `o200k_base.tiktoken` from OpenAI
- **Verify:** Check internet connectivity and that `openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net` is reachable
- **Effect:** Token counts use a heuristic (`len(text) / 4`) — functional but approximate
- **Fix:** The server retries on next startup. To force a retry now, delete `~/.cache/semantic-cache-mcp/tokenizer/` and restart.

**"Hash verification failed, re-downloading"**
- **Cause:** Corrupted or incomplete download
- **Fix:** Delete `~/.cache/semantic-cache-mcp/tokenizer/` and restart — a fresh download will be verified automatically

---

## Cache Issues

**"Database is locked"**
- **Cause:** Multiple MCP server instances accessing the same database
- **Fix:** Ensure only one instance of `semantic-cache-mcp` is running. Check with `pgrep semantic-cache-mcp`.

**Cache not reducing tokens**
- **Cause:** Files haven't been read yet (cold cache), or `diff_mode=False` is set
- **Fix:** The first `read` of any file populates the cache. Subsequent reads return diffs. Use `stats` to verify files are being cached.

**All files reporting "unchanged" after model context compression**
- **Cause:** The cache tracks filesystem state (mtime), not LLM context state. After context compression, the LLM no longer has the file content, but the cache still reports the file as unchanged.
- **Fix:** Call `batch_read` or `read` with `diff_mode=False` to force full content return, bypassing the cache hit path.
  ```
  batch_read paths="src/**/*.py" diff_mode=false
  ```

**Stale content returned**
- **Cause:** File was modified outside normal flow (e.g., by another process) and the mtime wasn't updated
- **Fix:** Use `clear` to reset the cache, or delete `~/.cache/semantic-cache-mcp/vecdb.db` and restart

**`search` or `similar` returns no results**
- **Cause:** These tools only search cached files. If the cache is empty or the relevant files haven't been read, nothing will match.
- **Fix:** Seed the cache first with `read` or `batch_read`, then call `search` or `similar`.

**`search` or `similar` results seem stale after adding many files**
- **Cause:** New files need to be cached (via `read` or `batch_read`) before they appear in search results. The HNSW index is updated when files are cached.
- **Fix:** Run `batch_read` on the new files first, then search again.

## Performance Issues

**Slow first startup**
- **Cause:** Embedding model download (~130MB) on first use, followed by ONNX initialization
- **Expected:** Normal on first use. Model is cached in `~/.cache/semantic-cache-mcp/models/`.

**High memory usage**
- **Cause:** Embedding model holds ~200MB resident (ONNX Runtime + bge-small-en-v1.5 weights) + vector index
- **Options:**
  - Use `clear` to evict cached entries and reduce DB size
  - Reduce `MAX_CACHE_ENTRIES` to lower the number of cached entries

**Glob timeout**
- **Cause:** Very broad pattern (e.g., `**/*.py` on a large monorepo) exceeds the 5-second timeout
- **Fix:** Narrow the pattern or add a `directory` argument to limit scope. The timeout is a safety guard — results up to the timeout are still returned.

## Debug Logging

Enable verbose logging to diagnose issues:

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
semantic-cache-mcp
```

## Getting Help

1. **Enable debug logging:** `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG semantic-cache-mcp`
2. **Check the cache:** `stats` tool shows file count, token totals, and savings percentage
3. **Reset state:** `clear` tool resets all cache entries; deleting `~/.cache/semantic-cache-mcp/` does a full reset
4. **Report issues:** [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CoderDayton/semantic-cache-mcp/issues)
